/**
 * The TransactionService of the MMS Client is responsible for handling requests
 * to initiate client-transactions sent from:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The Proxy-Relay (Through Push messages)</li>
 * <li>The composer/viewer activities of the MMS Client (Through intents)</li>
 * </ul>
 * The TransactionService runs locally in the same process as the application.
 * It contains a HandlerThread to which messages are posted from the
 * intent-receivers of this application.
 * <p/>
 * <b>IMPORTANT</b>: This is currently the only instance in the system in
 * which simultaneous connectivity to both the mobile data network and
 * a Wi-Fi network is allowed. This makes the code for handling network
 * connectivity somewhat different than it is in other applications. In
 * particular, we want to be able to send or receive MMS messages when
 * a Wi-Fi connection is active (which implies that there is no connection
 * to the mobile data network). This has two main consequences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Testing for current network connectivity ({@link android.net.NetworkInfo#isConnected()} is
 * not sufficient. Instead, the correct test is for network availability
 * ({@link android.net.NetworkInfo#isAvailable()}).</li>
 * <li>If the mobile data network is not in the connected state, but it is available,
 * we must initiate setup of the mobile data connection, and defer handling
 * the MMS transaction until the connection is established.</li>
 * </ul>
